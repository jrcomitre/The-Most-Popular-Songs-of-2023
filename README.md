# Power BI Project

Visualization Project: The Most Popular Songs of 2023

In this project, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze the most popular songs of 2023, using a comprehensive dataset sourced from Spotify and other platforms such as Apple Music, Deezer, and Shazam. The dataset included track names, artists, release dates, playlist and chart appearances, streaming statistics, and various audio features. To enhance the visualization and user experience, I integrated tools and languages such as Python, HTML, DENEB, and leveraged ChatGPT to help structure insights. The main goal was to deepen my skills in data visualization and create a visually engaging and informative piece for my portfolio.

This project demonstrates a Power BI dashboard for data analysis.
